Note to self: node_friendly_names.bin is modified in this repo compared to isolation_testground, it does not start with an entry count.
Might want to update this backwards into the other repo to avoid confusion when copying new updates.

cathode_id_map is the dump from the A:I binary which map params/enums/nodes to their string names
node_friendly_names is the dump from the 64-bit A:I COMMANDS.BIN files, which maps most nodes to their editor name
