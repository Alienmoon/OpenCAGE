This contains the node info dbs for the "alpha" Cathode editor (WinForms version).
Please keep this up to date with the ones used in `SceneIO\data\name_dbs`.

Note to self: node_friendly_names.bin is modified in this repo compared to isolation_testground, it does not start with an entry count.
Might want to update this backwards into the other repo to avoid confusion when copying new updates.
