# Contributing to LegendPlugin

Thanks for taking an interest to improve the Alien Isolation mod tools!

Adding to the project is simple:
- Create your own fork
- Commit any changes to your fork
- Generate a pull request in this repo

New contributions that update the toolkit require an update to the executable's version number, as this will trigger the tool's auto-update feature once the pull request is accepted.

To update the version number, navigate to project properties in Visual Studio, select Assembly Information, and increment the assembly/file version appropriately.

The project is built with Visual Studio 2017 and requires an up-to-date compiled executable in any pull requests.
